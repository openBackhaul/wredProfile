        This datatype represents the '<<Metaclass>> Class' from the UML metamodel.
        An instance of the referencing Class (e.g. LTP) will reference a Class (not an instance).
        This referenced Class will provide definition to extend the referencing instance.
        So, for example, an LTP instance will have the attributes defined in the LTP class and also the attributes defined in the referenced Class (an LtpSpec).
        The referenced Class may:
        (1) provide invariant properties (that are the same for many instances) that then are not conveyed with the referencing instance.
        (2) provide definitions for attributes that are present in the instance that are not defined in the Class of the instance (these attribute may have been pruned and refactored from one or more external definition sources).
        (3) apply constraints to attributes in the instance that were defined in the class of the referencing instance.
        (4) replace attributes that were present in the class of the referencing instance by a new definition (same name).;

    fc-switch:
      description: |-
        The FcSwitch class models the switched forwarding of traffic (traffic flow) between FcPorts and is present where there is protection functionality in the FC.
        If an FC exposes protection (having two or more FcPorts that provide alternative identical inputs/outputs), the FC will have one or more associated FcSwitch objects to represent the alternative flow choices visible at the edge of the FC.
        The FC switch represents and defines a protection switch structure encapsulated in the FC and essentially 'decorates' FCs that are involved in resilience schemes that use switching in a protection mechanism.
        Essentially FcSwitch performs one of the functions of the Protection Group in a traditional model. It associates 2 or more FcPorts each playing the role of a Protection Unit.
        One or more protection, i.e. standby/backup, FcPorts provide protection for one or more working (i.e. regular/main/preferred) FcPorts where either protection or working can feed one or more protected FcPort.
        The switch may be used in revertive or non-revertive (symmetric) mode. When in revertive mode it may define a waitToRestore time.
        It may be used in one of several modes including source switched, destination switched, source and destination switched etc. (covering cases such as 1+1 and 1:1).
        It may be locked out (prevented from switching), force switched or manual switched.
        It will indicate switch state and change of state.
        The switch can be switched away from all sources such that it becomes open and hence two coordinated switches can both feed the same LTP so long as at least one of the two is switched away from all sources (is 'open').
        The ability for a Switch to be 'high impedance' allows bidirectional ForwardingConstructs to be overlaid on the same bidirectional LTP where the appropriate control is enabled to prevent signal conflict.
        This ability allows multiple alternate routes to be present that otherwise would be in conflict.

      description: |-
        The ForwardingDomain (FD) class models the topological component that represents a forwarding capability that provides the opportunity to enable forwarding (of specific transport characteristic information at one or more protocol layers) between points.
        The FD object provides the context for and constrains the formation, adjustment and removal of FCs and hence offers the potential to enable forwarding.
        The FCs may be formed between LTPs at the boundary of the FD or between AccessPorts at the boundary of the FD (for the most basic media layers cases - most media cases use LTPs).
        A number of FDs (related by Links) may be grouped and abstracted to form an FD where that FD represents the effect of the underlying FDs but where the detailed structure is not apparent.
        This grouping and abstraction is potentially recursive.
        This aspect is essentially equivalent to ITU-T partitioning but this is an aggregation not a composition, so it allows an FD to be in multiple higher level FDs.
        The notion of abstraction/grouping assumes that small things are brought together into larger things as opposed to ITU-T partitioning that assumes large things are broken down into smaller things.
        An FD represents an abstraction of some combination of software behavior, electronic behavior and physical structure that provides a forwarding capability.
        At a lower level of recursion an FD could represent a forwarding capability within a device.
        A device may encompass two or more disjoint forwarding capabilities and may support more than one layer protocol, hence more than one FD.
        A routing fabric may be logically partitioned to represent connectivity constraints, hence the FD representing the routing fabric may be partitioned into a number of FDs representing the constraints.
        The FD represents a subnetwork [ITU-T G.800], FlowDomain [TMF 612] and a MultiLayerSubNetwork (MLSN) [TMF 612].
        As in the TMF concept of MLSN the FD can support more than one layer-protocol.
        Note that the ITU-T G.800 subnetwork is a single layer entity.

        The ForwardingConstruct (FC) represents enabled constrained potential for forwarding between two or more FcPorts at a particular specific layerProtocol .
        The constraint is explained by the FcSpec. Even when an FC is in place enabling potential for flow, it is possible that no information is flowing as there is no flow matching the constraint, hence 'potential'.
        Like the LTP, the FC supports any transport protocol including all analogue, circuit and packet forms.
        The FC is used to effect forwarding of transport characteristic (layer protocol) information.
        An FC can be in only one ForwardingDomain (FD).
        The FC is a forwarding entity.
        At a low level of the recursion, a FC represents a cross-connection within an NE. It may also represent a fragment of a cross-connection under certain circumstances.
        The FC object can be used to represent many different structures including point-to-point (P2P), point-to-multipoint (P2MP), rooted-multipoint (RMP) and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) bridge and selector structures for linear, ring or mesh protection schemes.
        When applied to media, the FC represents the ability for a flow/wave (potentially containing information), to be propagated between FcPorts.
        The existence of a FC instance is independent of the presence (or absence) of a flow/wave (and any information encoded within it) where flow/wave covers the progressing of any analogue or digital (packet/frame etc.) structure.
        A flow/wave cannot propagate in the absence of a FC instance.

        The traffic forwarding between the associated FcPorts of the FC depends upon the type of FC and may be associated with FcSwitch object instances.
        In cases where there is resilience, the FcPort may convey the resilience role of the access to the FC.
        It can represent a protected (resilient/reliable) point or a protecting (unreliable working/main or protection/spare) point.
        The FcPort replaces the Protection Unit of a traditional protection model (e.g., ITU-T).
        The ForwardingConstruct can be considered as a component and the FcPort as a Port on that component.

              A lower value of selection priority is preferred
              If two resources have the same value they are of equal priority.
              There is no preference between equal priorities.
              If a resource with the lowest value selection priority fails,, then the next lowest value available (may be the same value) is picked.
              Hence on failure of the current resource the next best available will be selected.
              If there are several equal values, the choice is essentially arbitrary.
              If the scheme is revertive then when a resource of higher priority than the currently selected resource recovers it will be selected.
              This is equivalent to working/protection but allows for all static scheme types with n:m capability.
              In simple schemes 0 = working and 1 = protecting.
              If selection priority of an FcPort is increased in value and the FC is currently selecting this FcPort then if another FcPort of a lower selection priority value is available, the wait to restore process will come into action as if the other FcPort had just become available.
              If selection priority of a FcPort is changed and the FC is not currently selecting this FcPort but is selecting an item that is now of a higher numeric value than the changed FcPort then the wait to restore process will come into action as if the other FcPort had just become available.
